Big Exchange
----------

Contains a heterogeneous publication graph of 17 integrated datasets covering archaeological finds of 11 different materials as well as their context information.

nodes.csv
---------
Each line contains a type ID as integers indicating which type the node indicated by the line number has (in line 1 the first node is referenced).
For example, line 1 having a value of 0 signifies that the first node (line 1, ID 0) has the first node type (as type counting starts at 0), which is explained in node_types.csv.

node_types.csv
--------------
Each line maps a node type ID (starting at 0) to its textual description.
For example, line 1 containing the value 'Country' signifies that the first node type (node type ID 0) has the label 'Country'.
Hence, node 1 from the previous example is a country-type node.


edges.csv
---------
Each line contains a source node ID, edge type ID, and destination node IDs, all encoded as integers and separated by comma.
The edge IDs is indicated by the line number.
For example, line 1 '95,0,4654' signifies that the first edge (line 1, ID 0) of the first edge type (ID 0) points from node 95 to node 4654.
The entries are primarily sorted by the souce node ID, followed by the edge type ID, followed by the destination node ID.

edge_type.csv
-------------
Each line maps an edge type ID (starting at 0) to its textual description.
For example, line 1 containing the value 'culture_literature' signifies that the first edge type (edge type ID 0) has the label 'culture_literature'.
Hence, edge 0 from the previous example is a 'culture_literature'-type edge.


schema.csv
----------
Each line maps an edge type ID indicated by the line number to its source node type ID and its destination type ID, separated by comma.
For example, line 1 containing '1,2' signifies that the first edge type (ID 0) points from nodes of type 1 to nodes of type 2.
